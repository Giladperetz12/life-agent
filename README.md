# Life Agent

A basic rule-based personal life management agent.

The agent analyzes personal data such as emails and calendar events,
decides what action to take, and runs autonomously using a basic agent loop.

This project focuses on clean architecture and agent-based design,
without relying on external APIs or complex AI models.
